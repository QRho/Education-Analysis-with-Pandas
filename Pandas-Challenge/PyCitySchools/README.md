### Education Analysis 


1.) Control forward slash to comment out things 
2.) Tab to bring up long name of perviously typed things you dont want to type again

### District Summary
The only easy part

### School Summary
Summary complete
But not before I made Individual cells to test every single part of it before I moved on to combine then into a df.
Please Ignore my working cells and commented out work, I like to save my work here because there was the Lambda function that might later come in handy. 

### Top School Summary & Bottom School
Used the ascending function and headed it.

### Math Scores by Grade 
This is interesting Data and this info could be used to address , which teachers are effecting the students and at what ages grades are effected are good etc.

### Reading Scores by Grade
Same here. 

### Scores by Spending
Here I did experiment some so again please disregaurd my commented out sections.

### Scores by Size
The actual dataframe is printed out in the second cell becuase I needed to view the DF in order to pull the right names etc.. That first box is for reference.
