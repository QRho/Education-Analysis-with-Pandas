### README for the Pandas Challege

I learned a lot of shortcuts along the way ( not actual work shortcuts but shortkeys like 
1.)control forward slash to comment out things 
2.) Tab to bring up long name of perviously typed things you dont want to type again
### District Summary
The only easy part of this homework

### School Summary
I solved it! 
But not before I made Individual cells to test every single part of it before I moved on to combine then into a df.
Had come confusion over this initially as it is more robust than the one line df before it. 
Please Ignore my working cells and commented out work, I like to save my work here because there was the Lambda function that mark taught me that might later come in handy. 

### Top School Summary & Bottom School
Used the ascending function and headed it.

### Math Scores by Grade 
This is interesting Data and this info could be used to address , which teachers are effecting the students and at what ages grades are effected are good etc.

### Reading Scores by Grade
Same here. 

### Scores by Spending
Here I did experiment some so again please disregaurd my commented out sections.

### Scores by Size
The actual dataframe is printed out in the second cell becuase I needed to view the DF in order to pull the right names etc.. That first box is for reference.

### Scores by Type
